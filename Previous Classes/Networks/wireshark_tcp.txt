9.	The smallest window size recieved is 5840. This does not apear to cause any throttling. 

10.	No. I checked for repeated sent sequence numbers. Also in the time/sequence graph there is no drop off. 

11.	Typicaly one or two segments are ack'd at a time. For example, see the capture in 7 and 8. 

12.	Avg MBit/sec: 0.187. Found using Statistics Summary. 

13.	The slow start ends after about the first tenth of a second. The capture differs from the theoretical behavior in that the flow never drops off. 

14.	My transfer was significantly different from the given sample. The slow start once again ends in about the first tenth of a second, but the window size grows and shrinks rapidly, singifying network problems. 


My computer uses TCP Tahoe: when there are repeat acks recived the window colapses all the way.
