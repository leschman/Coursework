a1. 00:d0:59:a9:3d:68
a2. 00:06:25:da:af:73 MAC address for gateway.
a3. 08 00 IP protocol
a4. The G apears 55 bytes into the frame. 

b An ARP querry is sent as a broadcast so that it is forwarded to all hosts on the network because the requesting host does not know the MAC of the sought host. The responce comes back directly to the requesting host because the broadcast has a source address that the responding host can use to directly comunicate with the requesting host. 

c12a. The operation code begins after 20 bytes. 
c12b. 00 01 for request and 00 02 for reply
c12c. THe senders IP is in the ARP request. 
c12d. At the End.
c13a. THe reply is 60 bytes long. 
c13b. The opcode is 00 02
c13c. The sender (responders) IP address is 32bytes into the frame. 
c14. Source: 00:06:25:da:af:73 Dest: 00:d0:59:a9:3d:68
c15. There is no ARP reply because the request is not for this machine. 

d "the "Reachable Time" value is somewhere between 15 seconds (30 × 0.5 seconds) and 45 seconds (30 × 1.5 seconds). If an entry is not used for a time between 15 to 45 seconds, it changes to the "Stale" state. Then, the host must send an ARP Request for IPV4 to the network when any IP datagram is sent to that destination."
