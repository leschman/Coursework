Question 16:
	I like how Prolog figures things out, like who is the grandfather of whom. It's cool how it can deduce things. I also like how if you mistype something at the prompt it offers suggestions instead of breaking. 

Question 17:
	I dislike having to add each individual fact to the list of facts. I understand that they need to be added, but I wish there was an abbreviated method like when a constructor is called how you can just input the data all at once without needing to list the fields it fills. I also dislike needing to type out full names of data sets, like 'Queen Elizabeth II'. I wish SWI-Prolog had a auto-complete.
	
Question 18:
	Overall it was a pleasant way to spend an afternoon. I enjoyed how easy Prolog was to pick up and use. I disliked needing to add in some more people to the list of facts to test things like Aunt by Marriage.

Question 19:
	About four hours. Two of which I was partially distracted by my wife playing Skyrim. 
	
Question 20:
	I doubt it. It is cool and all but I don't know what I would use it for besides solving some sort of logic puzzle, and even then it seems more efficient to figure it out in my head.
