##Highlights##
--------------
These are some of the projects I particularly enjoyed working on and found interesting:
* [Compiler](Compilers/) for the MICRO language. I'm taking the course as an independent study this fall, so it's still in progress. Currently I have a working tokenizer and am working on creating a parser using PLY. I also created several functional tests using Nosetest and the sample input/output files provided by my instructor. 
* [Machine Learning](MachineLearning/) another course I'm still taking, so it currently only has our first paper comparing different algorithms statistically to see how they preform. I was responsible for selecting the datasets, introducing the algorithims, running some of our experiments and all the statistical analysis of their performance. 
* I designed a custom [8-bit embeded system in VHDL](Previous%20Classes/Logic%20Design/Final%20Project) as part of my Minor in Computer Engineering.  
* I wrote a [research paper examining the use of peer to peer networks for enterprise class applications](Previous%20Classes/Technical%20Writing/Research%20Paper.docx).
